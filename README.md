My Portfolio Site built dynamically using JavaScript, SASS, Grunt, HTML, NPM, and JSON.

My idea with this project was to build a site but make the management of it easye.  So I decided to feed JavaScript some JSON data from a Firebase DB and the JS builds the site by injecting the content with ES6 string templating. This allows the app to be easily modified, updated, and reworked as needed.
