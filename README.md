# carterCapo
My Portfolio Site built dynamically using JavaScript, SASS, Grunt, HTML, NPM, and JSON.

My idea with this project was to build a template.  So I decided to feed JavaScript some JSON data and the JS builds the site by injecting the content.  In the future, I hope to hook this up to a MongoDB database deployed with Heroku and develop an administrative page where I can use front end facing modules to manage content essentially creating a CMS.

To use:  Visit www.cartercapo.com or clone this repo, npm install, then look in src/js/buildData.js and plug in your own data.  The javascript will build the site for you!
