My Portfolio Site built dynamically using JavaScript, SASS, Grunt, HTML, NPM, and JSON.

My idea with this project was to build a site but make the management of it easye.  So I decided to feed JavaScript some JSON data from a Firebase DB and the JS builds the site by injecting the content with ES6 string templating. This allows the app to be easily modified, updated, and reworked as needed.

To use:  Visit www.cartercapo.com or clone this repo, npm install, then look in src/js/buildData.js and plug in your own data.  The javascript will build the site for you!
